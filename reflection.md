What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?


I did not understand several aspects of this assignment. I mainly struggled with the relationship between the two classes (computer and resale shop). I didn't quite understand how information from one class gets passed to another, specifically when trying to call information from computer into resale shop.

I think the main source of my issues was trying to convert code straight from the procedural example into the object oriented file. When rethinking this assignent, I need to take a step back, plan, and think about what I would code regardless of the procedural example.

I found the A2 introduction video on Moodle very helpful as a starting point. It helped me understand the purpose of the assignment and some of the basic elements that would help me later on.

I would tell someone taking this course in the future to start as early as possible and plan ahead. I may have gone wrong by starting to code too quickly without thinking about the process I needed to get to the end.
